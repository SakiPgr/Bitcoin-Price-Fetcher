# bitcointest
A colleague of mine likes to ask about the current price of Bitcoin. I wrote a few lines and ran it on repl.it. Just for fun he said we should write a small script to get the price in dollar and euro and keep it in a excel file just to be able to have a look at how the prices change. It is a small project since I do this just for fun.
